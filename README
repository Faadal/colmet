Colmet - Collecting metrics about jobs running in a distributed environnement

Introduction:
-------------
Colmet is a monitoring tool to collect metrics about jobs running in a
distributed environnement, especially for gathering metrics on clusters and
grids. It provides currently several backends :
    - taskstats: fetch task metrics from the linux kernel
    - stdout: display the metrics on the terminal
    - zeromq: transport the metrics across the network
    - hdf5: store the metrics on the filesystem

Installation:
-------------
For detailed instructions on how to install Colmet on your plateform, please
refer to the INSTALL document in the same directory as this document. Please
carefully read the REQUIREMENTS section of the INSTALL instructions.

Usage:
------
Colmet has one main scripts:
    'colmet.py' to run on the nodes.

One example :

    for the nodes :

        sudo colmet -vvv \
            -i taskstats -p 1 -j 42 \
            -o zeromq --zeromq-uri tcp://127.0.0.1:5556

    for the aggregator :

        colmet -vvv -d 10  \
            -i zeromq_aggregator --zeromq-bind-uri tcp://127.0.0.1:5556 \
            -o zeromq --zeromq-uri tcp://127.0.0.1:5557

    for the collector :

        colmet -vvv \
             -i zeromq --zeromq-bind-uri tcp://127.0.0.1:5557 \
             -o none

    You will see the number of counters retrieved in the debug log.
